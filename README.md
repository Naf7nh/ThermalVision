# ThermalVision

This repository is for setting up a thermal imaging-based edge computing system using a Raspberry Pi and a FLIR Lepton thermal camera. The objective of this repository is to provide step-by-step guidance on how to set up a thermal imaging-based edge computing system using Raspberry Pi and develop an algorithm for occupancy detection in buildings. This repository comprises two main components: a tutorial detailing the hardware portion and the Python code for creating a CNN to detect up to 4 people in an image.
