# ThermalVision

This repository is for setting up a thermal imaging-based edge computing system using a Raspberry Pi and a FLIR Lepton thermal camera. The objective of this repository is to provide step-by-step guidance on how to set up a thermal imaging-based edge computing system using Raspberry Pi and develop an algorithm for occupancy detection in buildings. This repository comprises two main components: a tutorial detailing the hardware portion and the Python code for creating a CNN to detect up to 4 people in an image. 

## Contents of the Files 

### Tutorial 
The tutorial PDF outlines the system's objective, lists the components used, provides a step-by-step process for assembling the hardware components, and explains the system's configuration on the Raspberry Pi.

### Training Script 
The Python file contains the script that is used to train the alogrithm that is used to detect occupants in the designated spaces
