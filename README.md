# ThermalVision

This is a repository for setting up the thermal imaging-based edge computing system using a Raspberry Pi and Flir Lepton thermal camera. The objective of this repository is to provide a step-by-step guidance of how to set up thermal imaging based edge computing system using Raspberry Pi and develop an algorithm for occupancy detection in buildings. This repository has two main components: The tutorial detailing the hardware portion and the Python code for developing a CNN for detecting up to 4 people in an image. 






provided here contains the objective of this system, the components used, step by step process of putting the hardware components together, and the configuration of the system. Tablk about the hw setup and the CNN for. Emphasizing thr importance as well the coding section
